I am a Cybersecurity-focused Computer Science student (pre-final year) at <a href="https://www.manipal.edu/mu/campuses/mahe-bengaluru/academics/institution-list/mitblr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manipal Institute of Technology</a>, actively preparing for SOC and Blue Team roles.

Certified with CompTIA Security+ and CySA+, with hands-on experience in:
- SIEM & log analysis (Splunk concepts)
- Incident response & alert triage
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Active Directory attacks & privilege escalation
- Network & system security (Linux, Windows Server, TCP/IP, DNS)

I regularly practice on platforms like <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/public/users/596366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackTheBox.</a> and TryHackMe and work on practical security projects including Active Directory security assessments and automation scripts using Python and Bash.

Currently seeking Cybersecurity / SOC Analyst internships where I can contribute to real-world detection, monitoring, and response while continuing to grow as a security professional.

Outside of my academics, I enjoy playing football. I did participate in many inter-school/college tournaments. Along with that, I like working out and pushing my limits. Writing short security breakdowns either attack paths that I learn or weekly security news in my own words is something I like.
