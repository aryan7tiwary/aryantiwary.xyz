> When we joined the Kaspersky Industrial Cybersecurity Hackathon, we wanted to show that AI can spot industrial cyberattacks as they happen — even subtle ones that humans might miss — using realistic, hands-on simulations.

---

> # 1. The Idea & Vision
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) run the world quietly in the background — they control our power grids, water treatment plants, manufacturing lines, and more. But these systems weren’t built with cybersecurity in mind. In today’s world, that’s a dangerous gap.

>When we joined the Kaspersky Industrial Cybersecurity Hackathon, we wanted to show that AI can spot industrial cyberattacks as they happen — even subtle ones that humans might miss — using realistic, hands-on simulations.

>That’s how HackSkyICS came to life. Our main goal:
* Simulate a real ICS network using virtualization.
* Launch actual ICS-specific cyberattacks on it.
* Detect anomalies in real-time using machine learning and an LLM.

>The focus was purely on detection, not on stopping or reversing the attack. And despite that scope, we ended up as one of the Top 15 teams in the hackathon.

> # 2. Quick Primer – ICS, IT, and OT
If you come from an IT-only background, here’s a quick context:
* IT (Information Technology) → Your usual servers, databases, web apps, and emails. Downtime is bad, but mostly an inconvenience.
* OT (Operational Technology) → The tech that makes the physical world work — turbines, pumps, PLCs, conveyor belts. Downtime here can cause massive damage or even risk lives.
* ICS (Industrial Control Systems) sits inside OT. It’s a combination of hardware, software, and networks that control industrial processes — typically via PLCs and SCADA systems.

>The tricky part: many ICS protocols like Modbus and DNP3 have zero built-in security. They trust anything that talks to them, which is why attacks like [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet) were possible.

> # 3. Building HackSkyICS – The Core Architecture
We went heavy on virtualization to create a controlled yet realistic environment. The setup:
* Attack VM – Kali Linux with Metasploit, Modbus exploitation scripts, and network scanning tools.
* ICS VM – Ubuntu Server running OpenPLC + ModbusPal, simulating a water treatment plant.
* Monitoring VM – Python + Node.js environment running our ML models and anomaly detection logic.
* Display VM (HMI) – React-based SCADA dashboard showing live sensor readings and system status.

>All of them were connected to a virtual network (192.168.100.0/24) to mimic a real plant setup.
We used OpenPLC for its open-source flexibility and native Modbus support, and ModbusPal for generating realistic sensor values.

> # 4. The Attack Simulation
One of our main demo scenarios involved a parameter manipulation attack.

>From the Kali attack VM, we connected to the Modbus registers controlling voltage in the water treatment system. Then we subtly increased the value — not enough to trigger obvious alarms, but enough to cause long-term damage in a real system.

>From the operator’s SCADA dashboard, everything looked “mostly fine.” No flashing alerts, just slightly off readings. This is exactly the kind of scenario where anomaly detection shines.

> # 5. Our AI/ML Detection Model
We built HackSkyICS to use two key ML approaches:
* Isolation Forest (scikit-learn) – An unsupervised method that detects data points that don’t fit normal patterns. Perfect for catching unknown or zero-day attacks.
* Autoencoder (PyTorch) – A deep learning model trained on normal sensor patterns. If it struggles to “rebuild” the incoming data, that’s a strong anomaly signal.

> ![Detection](/assets/images/HackSky/detection.png)

>Why both?
* ICS attacks can be subtle drifts in data (great for Isolation Forest).
* Or they can be completely new patterns (Autoencoder catches these).

>We trained using both clean operational data and simulated attack data. The result:

    Accuracy: 92.42%

    Detection time: <500ms

    Alerts in real-time to the operator dashboard.

> # 6. The LLM Integration
On top of ML detection, we added a fine-tuned LLM trained on ICS/Modbus logs.

>The idea was simple: operators shouldn’t have to read endless log entries. They should be able to just ask:

    “Is something wrong with the voltage in Line 3?”

>The LLM could check logs, correlate ML alerts, and respond in plain language:

    “Voltage anomaly detected. Register 40005 shows deviation from baseline by +12%.”

>In our voltage manipulation attack, the LLM caught it and reported it clearly.

> # 7. Challenges We Faced
* VM Networking – Making four VMs communicate smoothly on the same subnet took a lot of trial and error.
* Real-time Performance – ML inference had to be fast enough to not delay dashboard updates.
* Data Availability – Industrial attack datasets aren’t public, so we had to create and label our own.
* Resource Limits – Running this all on a laptop while keeping CPU load low was tricky.

> # 8. Why HackSkyICS is Different
A lot of ICS security demos either:

    Show the attack, or

    Show the detection model.

>We combined both into one integrated platform where:

    The attack is real (via Kali + Modbus manipulation).

    The detection is AI-driven.

    The data is visualized instantly on a SCADA-like interface.

>It’s a realistic training ground for anyone learning OT cybersecurity.

> # 9. Takeaways from the Kaspersky Hackathon
What made us stand out was that HackSkyICS wasn’t just a model — it was a complete working environment where people could see an attack happen and then watch the system detect it in real-time.

That live element impressed the judges, and it’s what helped us land in the Top 15.

> # 10. The Bigger Picture
ICS attacks are getting more common, and they’re dangerous because they target the physical world.

>HackSkyICS is a proof-of-concept that shows:
* How AI can catch anomalies that humans or simple rules might miss.
* How realistic simulation environments can be built without needing physical ICS hardware.
* How cyber ranges for OT can be designed for training purposes.

>For the future, adding prevention or automated response is possible — but for now, HackSkyICS is about seeing the threat as it happens and learning how to respond.
